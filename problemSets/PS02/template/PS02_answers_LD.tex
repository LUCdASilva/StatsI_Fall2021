	\section*{Question 1 (40 points): Political Science}
		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

\newpage
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 \\
		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
	\vspace{.2cm}

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=14, lastline=52]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The chi-square is 3.791168.
	\vspace{1cm}

	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = .1$?\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
		
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=58, lastline=66]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The p-value is 0.1502306. We cannot reject the null hypothesis (that class of the drivers and bribe solicitation are statistically independent), because the p-value is greater than our alpha level of 0.1.
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\item [(c)] Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.
	\vspace{.2cm}

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=76, lastline=83]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class & 0.1360828 & -0.8153742 & 0.818923 \\
			\\
			Lower class & -0.1825742 & 1.0939393 & -1.098701 \\
			
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	\vspace{.2cm}

Note: I also attempted to calculate the residuals with a formula "by hand," but appear to have received incorrect results. Perhaps you can comment on what I did incorrectly below.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=34, lastline=42]{PS02_test.R}

\vspace{1cm}

	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?
	\vspace{.2cm}

The standardized residuals are useful in explaining where any deviations from independence might occur. This helps us to understand which values have high or low frequencies proportionally to their expected frequencies, and thus which values are contributing to the chi-square size. In this case, the overall chi-square is low, but much of the difference between observed and expected frequencies comes from the "bribe requested" and "stopped/given warning" values of the y variable. For these two values, the difference between the observed and expected frequencies are higher, whereas the standardized residuals for "not stopped" are quite low. This indicates that the driver's class did not impact whether they were stopped by the police by very much (or at all), maybe because the police could not know the driver's supposed class from afar. Meanwhile, the higher residuals for "bribe requested" and "stopped/given warning" indicate that the driver's class may affect whether police requested a bribe. They requested bribes more often from the lower class driver, while more often only stoping or giving a warning to the upper class driver. However, overall, the chi-square is not large enough to reject the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent.

\section*{Question 2 (20 points): Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.
\vspace{.2cm}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. 
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
H-null: The reservation policy does not affect the number of new/repaired drinking water facilities in the villages (the two variables are statistically independent).

H-alt: The reservation policy affects the number of new/repaired drinking water facilities in the villages (the two variables are statistically dependent).

	\vspace{1cm}
	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=118, lastline=121]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The y-intercept is 14.738 and the coefficient for the reserved variable is 9.252.	
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
The coefficient estimate of 9.252 indicates that villages with the reservation policy (x = 1) will have 9.252 more new/repaired drinking water facilities than those without the reservation policy (x = 0). Another way to describe this is to say that as x increases by one, y increases by 9.252. However, since x is dichotomous, it can only increase/decrease by one.

\end{enumerate}

	\section*{Question 3 (40 points): Biology}

There is a physiological cost of reproduction for fruit flies, such that it reduces the lifespan of female fruit flies.  Is there a similar cost to male fruit flies?  This dataset contains observations from five groups of 25 male fruit flies. The experiment tests if increased reproduction reduces longevity for male fruit flies. The five groups are: males forced to live alone, males assigned to live with one or eight newly pregnant females (non-receptive females), and males assigned to live with one or eight virgin females (interested females). The name of the data set is \texttt{fruitfly.csv}.\footnote{Partridge and Farquhar (1981).``Sexual Activity and the Lifespan of Male Fruitflies''. \textit{Nature}. 294, 580-581.}
	\vspace{1cm}

\begin{tabular}{r|l}
	\texttt{No} & serial number (1-25) within each group of 25\\
	\texttt{type} & Type of experimental assignment \\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $1=$ no females  \\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $2=$ 1 newly pregnant female \\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $3=$ 8 newly pregnant females\\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $4=$ 1 virgin female\\
	& \hspace{0.1in} $5=$ 8 virgin females\\
	\texttt{lifespan} & lifespan (days)\\
	\texttt{thorax} & length of thorax (mm)\\
	\texttt{sleep} & percentage of each day spent sleeping\\
\end{tabular}
	\vspace{1cm}
	
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item
	Import the data set and obtain summary statistiscs and examine the distribution of the overall lifespan of the fruitflies.  
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=140, lastline=150]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The data set has 125 observations of five variables. It is a data frame. "thorax" is composed of numbers and "lifespan" is composed of integers. The range of the lifespan is from 16-97 days. The first quartile is 46, median is 58, and third quartile is 70. The mean (57.44) is slightly lower than the median.
	\vspace{1cm}

	\item
	Plot \texttt{lifespan} vs \texttt{thorax}. Does it look like there is a linear relationship? Provide the plot. What is the correlation coefficient between these two variables?
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=160, lastline=164]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

\graphicspath{ {./Images/} }

\includegraphics{img_1}

The relationship appears relatively linear (and positive), with perhaps a slight upward curviture.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=168, lastline=169]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The correlation coefficient between these two variables is 0.6365.
		\vspace{1cm}
		
	\item
	Regress \texttt{lifespan} on \texttt{thorax}.  Interpret the slope of the fitted model.
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=177, lastline=178]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The intercept coefficient (alpha) is -61.05, and the coefficient (slope) for thorax (beta) is 144.33. This means that for an increase in thorax length of one mm, the fruitfly lifespan increases by 144.33 days. However, since the scales are smaller than this, a better way to explain the relationship is as follows: for an increase in thorax length of .01 mm, the fruitfly lifespan increases by 1.4433 days.
			\vspace{1cm}
			
	\item
	Test for a significant linear relationship between  \texttt{lifespan} and \texttt{thorax}. Provide and interpret your results of your test.
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=189, lastline=194]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The p-value is very near 0 and is statistically significant even with a significance level of less than .001. We can reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between the reservation policy and new/repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\item
	
	Provide the 90\% confidence interval for the slope of the fitted model.
			\vspace{.2cm}
			
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Use the formula of confidence interval.	
			\vspace{.2cm}	
		
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=202, lastline=224]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The confidence interval according to this formula is [118.1938, 170.4662].
		\vspace{.5cm}
		
		\item
		Use the function  \texttt{confint()}  in \texttt{R} .
			\vspace{.2cm}
		
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=228, lastline=229]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

The confidence interval according to the confint() function is [118.1962, 170.4700].
		
	\end{itemize}
			\vspace{1cm}
			
	\item Use the \texttt{predict()} function in \texttt{R} to (1) predict an individual fruitfly's lifespan when \texttt{thorax}=0.8 and (2) the average \texttt{lifespan} of fruitflies when \texttt{thorax}=0.8 by the fitted model. This requires that you compute prediction and confidence intervals. What are the expected values of lifespan? What are the prediction and confidence intervals around the expected values? 
		\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=236, lastline=241]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

This prediction is 54.41478 days, with a prediction interval of [27.37542, 81.45414].

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=244, lastline=246]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

This prediction is also 54.41478 days, with a much smaller interval of [51.91932, 56.91024].
			\vspace{1cm}
			
	\item	For a sequence of \texttt{thorax} values, draw a plot with their fitted values for \texttt{lifespan}, as well as the prediction intervals and confidence intervals.
	\vspace{.2cm}
	
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=253, lastline=273]{PS02_answers_LD.R}

\includegraphics{img_2}

The plot above shows the fitted values for lifespan as predicted by thorax length (blue line). It also has the confidence intervals (gray shading) and prediction intervals (dotted red lines). Just to provide additional information, I kept the scatterplot points as well.
